#In this project, I used SQL to query the Superstore database and got information about items sold at the store and their prices. 

# Which industries have an average revenue of at least $150 Billion, and what are their avg revenues?

SELECT industry, ROUND(AVG(revenue),1) as avg_revenue_billions
FROM fortune_companies
GROUP BY industry
HAVING avg_revenue_billions>=150

# Which companies have healthcare benefits *and* at least 20 paid time off days?

SELECT company_name
FROM fortune_companies
WHERE paid_time_off_days>=20
AND healthcare_benefits=1
;

# Which company in the Retail industry has the least revenue, and what's their revenue? 

SELECT company_name, min(revenue)
FROM fortune_companies
WHERE industry = 'Retail'
;

# Assign all the companies in the Healthcare industry as "mother friendly workplace", "acceptable", or "abysmal" based on 
the maternity leave offered. Order by maternity leave offered
